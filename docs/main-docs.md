# Main Documentation of the WINSCOPE Project

## Folder structure

The project contains few folders. Let's discuss what each folder content is:

1. .vscode (recently) - folder contains the vscode editor variables and configurations. At the moment it contains only the launch.json file which is the config file for debugging apps via the VS Code Debugger.

2. dist (old) - folder is created dynamically when the build command is executed. This folder contains index.html and bundle.js which is the bundled javascript logic of the app.

3. docs (recent) - contains the documentation for the folder structure, code explanation, architecture, functionality, wishlist etc.

4. external (old) - contains only one subfolder: `protobuf` which contains the external scripts that convert protobuf files to JSON files. (//TODO - more precise than this).

5. loaders (old) - loads protobuf files using `protobufjs` node module. (//TODO - more precise than this).

6. protos (old) - contains the proto files used from `protobufjs` to convert from protobuf to JSON. (//TODO - more precise than this).

7. src (old) -here is where the logic of this tool resides. Vue classes + html + CSS files are found here.
